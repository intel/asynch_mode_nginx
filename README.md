## Software Requirements

This release was validated on the following:

* OpenSSL-1.1.0h
* QAT engine v0.5.37

## Additional Information

* Async Mode Nginx SSL engine framework provides new directives:

**Directives**
```bash
Syntax:     ssl_asynch on | off;
Default:    ssl_asynch off;
Context:    stream, mail, http, server

    Enables SSL/TLS asynchronous mode
```
**Example**

file: conf/nginx.conf

```bash
    http {
        ssl_asynch  on;
        server {...}
    }
```

```bash
    stream {
        ssl_asynch  on;
        server {...}
    }
```

**Directives**
```bash
Syntax:     proxy_ssl_asynch on | off;
Default:    proxy_ssl_asynch off;
Context:    stream, http, server

Enables the SSL/TLS protocol asynchronous mode for connections to a proxied server.
```

**Example**

file: conf/nginx.conf

```bash
    http {
        server {
            location /ssl {
                proxy_pass https://127.0.0.1:8082/outer;
                proxy_ssl_asynch on;
            }
        }
    }
```

* Async Mode Nginx provide new option `asynch` for `listen` directive.

**Example**

file: conf/nginx.conf

```bash
    http {
        server{ listen 443 asynch; }
    }
```

* Support OpenSSL Cipher PIPELINE feature (Deitals information about the pipeline
  settings, please refer to [OpenSSL Docs][6])

**Directives**
```bash
Syntax:     ssl_max_pipelines size;
Default:    ssl_max_pipelines 0;
Context:    server

Set MAX number of pipelines
```

**Directives**
```bash
Syntax:     ssl_split_send_fragment size;
Default:    ssl_split_send_fragment 0;
Context:    server

Set split size of sending fragment
```

**Directives**
```bash
Syntax:     ssl_max_send_fragment size;
Default:    ssl_max_send_fragment 0;
Context:    server

Set max number of sending fragment
```

## Limitations

* Nginx supports `reload` operation, when QAT hardware is involved for crypto
  offload, user should enure that there are enough number of qat instances.
  For example, the available qat instance number should be 2x equal or more than
  Nginx worker process number.

    For example, in Nginx configuration file (`nginx.conf`) worker process number
is configured as

    ```bash
       worker_processes 16;
    ```

    Then the instance configuration in QAT driver configuration file should be

    ```bash
        [SHIM]
        NumberCyInstances = 1
        NumberDcInstances = 0
        NumProcesses = 32
        LimitDevAccess = 1
    ```

## Installation Instructions

### Install Async Mode Nginx

**Set the following environmental variables:**

`NGINX_INSTALL_DIR` is the directory where nginx will be installed to

`OPENSSL_LIB` is the directory where the openssl has been installed to

**Configure nginx for compilation:**

```bash
    ./configure \
        --prefix=$NGINX_INSTALL_DIR \
        --with-http_ssl_module \
        --add-dynamic-module=modules/nginx_qat_module/ \
        --with-cc-opt="-DNGX_SECURE_MEM -I$OPENSSL_LIB/include -Wno-error=deprecated-declarations" \
        --with-ld-opt="-Wl,-rpath=$OPENSSL_LIB/lib -L$OPENSSL_LIB/lib"
```

**Compile and Install:**

```bash
    make
    make install
```

### Build OpenSSL\* and QAT engine

These instructions can be found on [QAT engine][4]

[4]: https://github.com/intel/QAT_Engine#installation-instructions

## SSL Engine Framework for Configuration

As QAT engine is implemented as a standard OpenSSL\* engine, its behavior can be
controlled from the OpenSSL\* configuration file (`openssl.conf`), which can be
found on [QAT engine][5].

[5]: https://github.com/intel/QAT_Engine#using-the-openssl-configuration-file-to-loadinitialize-engines

**Note**:
From v0.3.2 and later, this kind of configuration in `openssl.conf` will not be
effective for Nginx. Please use the following method to configure Nginx SSL
engine, such as Intel&reg; QAT.

An SSL Engine Framework is introduced to provide a more powerful and flexible
mechanism to configure Nginx SSL engine directly in the Nginx configuration file
(`nginx.conf`).

### ssl_engine configuration
A new configuration block is introduced as `ssl_engine` which provides two
general directives:

```bash
Syntax:     use_engine [engine name];
Default:    N/A
Context:    ssl_engine
Description:
            Specify the engine name
```

```bash
Syntax:     default_algorithms [ALL/RSA/EC/...];
Default:    ALL
Context:    ssl_engine
Description:
            Specify the algorithms need to be offloaded to the engine
            More details information please refer to OpenSSL engine
```

A following configuration sub-block can be used to set engine specific
configuration. The name of the sub-block should have a prefix using the
engine name specified in `use_engine`, such as `[engine_name]_engine`.

### nginx_qat_module
Any 3rd party modules can be integrated into this framwork. By default, a
reference module `dasync_module` is provided in `src/engine/modules`
and a QAT module `nginx_qat_module` is provided in `modules/nginx_qat_modules`.

An example configuration in the `nginx.conf`:
```bash
    load_module modules/ngx_ssl_engine_qat_module.so;
    ...
    ssl_engine {
        use_engine qat;
        default_algorithms RSA,EC,DH,PKEY_CRYPTO;
        qat_engine {
            qat_offload_mode async;
            qat_notify_mode poll;
            qat_poll_mode heuristic;
            qat_shutting_down_release on;
        }
    }
```
For more details directives of `nginx_qat_module`, please refer to
`modules/nginx_qat_modules/README`.

## Support for Nginx Side Polling
The qat_module provides two kinds of nginx side polling for QAT engine,

* external polling mode
* heuristic polling mode

Please refer to the README file in the `modules/nginx_qat_modules` directory
to install this dynamic module.

**Note**:
External polling and heuristic polling are unavailable in SSL proxy and stream
module up to current release.

### External Polling Mode

A timer-based polling is employed in each Nginx worker process to collect
accelerator's response.

**Directives in the qat_module **
```bash
Syntax:     qat_external_poll_interval time;
Default:    1
Dependency: Valid if (qat_poll_mode=external)
Context:    qat_engine
Description:
            External polling time interval (ms)
            Valid value: 1 ~ 1000
```
**Example**
file: conf/nginx.conf

```bash
    load_module modules/ngx_ssl_engine_qat_module.so;
    ...
    ssl_engine {
        use_engine qat;
        default_algorithms ALL;
        qat_engine {
            qat_offload_mode async;
            qat_notify_mode poll;

            qat_poll_mode external;
            qat_external_poll_interval 1;
        }
    }
```


### Heuristic Polling Mode

This mode can be regarded as an improvement of the timer-based external polling.
It is the recommended polling mode to communicate with QAT accelerators because
of its performance advantages. With the knowledge of the offload traffic, it
controls the response reaping rate to match the request submission rate so as to
maximize system efficiency with moderate latency, and adapt well to diverse
types of network traffics.

**Note:**

* This mode is only available when using QAT engine v0.5.35 or later.
* External polling timer is enabled by default when heruistic polling mode is enabled.

In the heuristic polling mode, a polling operation is only trigerred at a proper moment:

* Number of in-flight offload requests reaches a pre-defined threshold (in consideration of efficiency)
* All the active SSL connections have submitted their cryptographic requests and been waitting for
the corresponding responses (in consideration of timeliness).

**Directives in the qat_module **
```bash
Syntax:     qat_heuristic_poll_asym_threshold num;
Default:    48
Dependency: Valid if (qat_poll_mode=heuristic)
Context:    qat_engine
Description:
            Threshold of the number of in-flight requests to trigger a polling
            operation when there are in-flight asymmetric crypto requests
            Valid value: 1 ~ 512


Syntax:     qat_heuristic_poll_sym_threshold num;
Default:    24
Dependency: Valid if (qat_poll_mode=heuristic)
Context:    qat_engine
Description:
            Threshold of the number of in-flight requests to trigger a polling
            operation when there is no in-flight asymmetric crypto request
            Valid value: 1 ~ 512
```
**Example**
file: `conf/nginx.conf`

```bash
    load_module modules/ngx_ssl_engine_qat_module.so;
    ...
    ssl_engine {
        use_engine qat;
        default_algorithms ALL;
        qat_engine {
            qat_offload_mode async;
            qat_notify_mode poll;

            qat_poll_mode heuristic;
            qat_heuristic_poll_asym_threshold 48;
            qat_heuristic_poll_sym_threshold 24;
        }
    }
```


## Known issue
** 'Orphan ring' errors in `dmesg` output when Nginx exit **
   Working with current QAT driver (version 1.0.3 in 01.org), Nginx workers exit
   with 'Orphan ring' errors. This issue has been fixed in next QAT driver release

** Cache manager/loader process will allocate QAT instance via QAT engine **
   According to current QAT engine design, child process forked by master
   process will initialize QAT engine automatically in QAT engine `atfork`
   hook function. If cache manager/loader processes are employed, QAT instances
   will be allocated in the same way as worker process. Cache manager/loader
   processes do not perform modules' `exit process` method in Nginx native design
   which will introduce "Orphan ring" error message in `dmesg` output.
